### Writing Good Commit Descriptions

Keep commit descriptions:

- Short and clear
- Written in the imperative mood
- Lowercase unless using a proper noun
- Focused on what changed, not how difficult it was

Good:
```text
fix(api): handle failed subject requests
```

Avoid:
```text
fixed stuff updated files changes work in progress
```

### Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, add `!` after the type or scope:
```text
feat(api)!: change subject response format
```
You can also include a footer:
```text
BREAKING CHANGE: subject responses now return items instead of data.
```
